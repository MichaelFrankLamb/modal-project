# modal-project

This repo is for practice/educational purposes, in collaboration with CCBear.

Main objective: 

Create a one-page website with a JS event listener that pops up an alert three seconds after the page loads.  The alert should give clear instructions to the user and provide a means of exit ("close" button or the like).

As a secondary objective, these docs are being used for general practice and experimentation with HTML/CSS layout.  The idea is to get "reps", improving skills and intuition with front-end layout.
